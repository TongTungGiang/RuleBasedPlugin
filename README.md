## About Rule Based Plugin
While AI plugins with behavior trees, finite state machine are all supported, this plugin is for rule-based AI NPCs. Your NPCs will be able to give their own decisions with your pre-defined rule set. But they won't make same decision all the time, because they have _characteristics_. An NPC produces different actions in two same situations, and two NPCs give you two decisions which are not similar to each other in the same situation.

## When you need to use it?
This is a plugin for you when you need to:
* You need your behavior system to be easily expanded whenever possible.
* You need to add some unpredictable factors from your bots into your game.
